    <p>1. Browser gives 404 error because .js script file was not loaded, maybe the .js file doesn't exist. In order to solve this, just create the .js file or copy it to source folder.</p>
    <p>2. Closing tag of script was placed in the wrong place, specifically, part of the body of html was inside script tag, closing script tag right after script tag would solve the problem</p>
    <p>3. There was a semicolon ; after the function name which is causing the error, if we delete it, we solve the problem. </p>
    <p>4. The closing bracket } of the first function is missing, if was close it, we solve the problem.</p>
