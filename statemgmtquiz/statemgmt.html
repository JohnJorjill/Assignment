<body>
    <p>1. POST requests can be bookmarked but there would be no parameters</p>
    <p>2. Request dispatcher dispatches requests to another resources like jsp or html</p>
    <p>3. Redirect - sends redirect URL and address bar will change the URL, forward - passes request to another resourse on the server and URL in browser stay same</p>
    <p>4. Attributes are object which we attach to the resource like jsp</p>
    <p>5. We set attributes to the object but we get parameters from the object, for example from request object in servlet</p>
    <p>6. If not used correctly, attributes might be thread unsafe</p>
    <p>7. HTTP is a stateless protocol which means there is no information stored about the state of connection between client and server. TCP is stateful because there is a information in packets in order to fix errors and reassemble after reaching destination.</p>
    <p>8. setAttribute(), getSession().setAttribute(), addCookie() can be used 2 ways, this.getServletContext().setAttribute()</p>
    <p>9. until user closes browser</p>
    <p>10. Temporary cookie will expire when browser is closed or can have expiriation time.</p>
    <p>11. URL Rewriting is modification of URL in servlet to include a session ID. It's used to store a session information when brower's cookies are not allowed.</p>
    <p>12. Because it's scope is only inside doGet() method and reporting method is doPost() it's out of it's scope</p>
